<p class="beer">The Bier Garden was an idea long before it was a neighborhood favorite. Inspired by Lighthouse Beer and Wine in Wrightsville Beach, NC, the idea was simple... create a place where the atmosphere and people were as good as the beer stacked on the shelf, and packed in the cooler. Whether you are looking to pick up a 6-pack or small-batch IPA, or just trying to have a quality beer while hanging with some buddies, The Beer Garden is the place for you. Some of our fine offerings are listed below:</p>
